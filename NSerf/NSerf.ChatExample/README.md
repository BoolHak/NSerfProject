# NSerf Chat Example

This example shows how to build a distributed chat application on top of NSerf.

It demonstrates:

- Cluster membership and failure detection
- Broadcasting messages across nodes using Serf user events
- A web UI implemented with ASP.NET Core and SignalR
- Running multiple chat nodes locally or via Docker Compose

For full setup and usage details, see the main repository documentation and comments in the `NSerf.ChatExample` project.
